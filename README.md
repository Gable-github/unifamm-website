Hi everyone,

This is my first real world coding project - a small one helping some relatives digitalize their company by creating a website for them. You can find the live website at unifammfoodingredients.com . Peep the website's footer!

Css was a pain in the ass, especially the css invloved in making the CONSULTATIONS/INGREDIENTS user interface on the homepage what you see and experience now. Its still
not formatted for some odd screen sizes, and only optimized perfectly for computers and iphones. 

I took about 1 month of picking up the basics of HTML CSS and JS, and an additional 1.5 months to create this project. the last 0.5 months since the inception of this project
were spent painstakingly updating and checking the responsiveness of the website for different phone sizes. Thanks to netlify, though, it was just tedious having to drag and drop updated files, instead of needing to commit and push every single change onto GitHub.

The code is currently still very unrefined. Ill do a major refactoring of the code once I've learned backend coding, and can expand the website to have a newsletter and userbase for Unifamm's consumer product.
